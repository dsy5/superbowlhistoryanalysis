description: "\nThe Super Bowl is one of, if not, America's most historic and prized
  cultural events. Every year, the games draw millions of viewers from around the
  country and world, creating a centripetal force that connects us viewers together
  for entertainment and unexpected drama. \n\nIn my second data science project, I
  decided to conduct exploratory data analysis on the first 55 Super Bowls in NFL
  History (from the 1966-1967 NFL Season to the 2020-2021 NFL Season), highlighting
  various trends in our games through stunning, colorful graphs. Although trends visualized through my analysis may
  not seem applicable to future games, it is interesting to note different patterns
  that have arisen throughout NFL's treasured and unpredictable history. \n\nI used
  the programming language *R* to achieve my goals. \n\nVisit my GitHub repository
  to see the code behind my works: https://github.com/dsy5/superbowlhistoryanalysis \n"
